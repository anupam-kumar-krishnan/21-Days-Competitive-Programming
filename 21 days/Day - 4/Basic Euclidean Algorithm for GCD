The algorithm is based on below facts.

- If we subtract smaller number from larger (we reduce larger number), GCD doesn’t change.
 So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
 
- Now instead of subtraction, if we divide smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
